Read this file before launching the MySQL-PHP test.

1. Make sure Apache server and MySQL server are both turned on.

2. Run the attached "Create-Insert-database.sql" file to complete the following steps: create database, table, records, and a new user. Note the user creation portion may only work on MySQL. 

3. If the step above runs successfully, MySQL server should show database "php_mysql_sample_db" , tables "login" and "nba" , with some records inserted, and a new user: tester/tester123 with sufficient privileges to operate on the database "php_mysql_sample_db" . 

4. Using a browser, open "login.html" to test on Login, and "search.html" to test on Search.
